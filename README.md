Solutions to Euler Project challenges as well as different algorithms from class.
Generally speaking, this is a great place to check out the work I've been doing and see how I code.
Some of the Euler problems may be updated if I think of a better solution.
During the academic year, progress in Project Euler halts as I focus my attention on my assignments.
